    calculate_fuel_cell_with_ducted_fan!(ac, case, imission, ip, initializes_engine, iterw = 0)

Calculates the performance of a fuel cell powering a ducted fan for the given mission point. 
This function handles both the design and off-design performance of the ducted fan and fuel cell system.

In the design case, the function sizes the ducted fan at the start of cruise and the fuel cell at takeoff conditions.
In the off-design case, it computes the power and thrust requirements for each mission segment.

!!! details "ðŸ”ƒ Inputs and Outputs"
    **Input:**
    - `ac::aircraft`: aircraft object containing geometry, mission, and propulsion data
    - `case::String`: case identifier, e.g., "design" or "off_design"
    - `imission::Int64`: mission index
    - `ip::Int64`: mission point index
    - `initializes_engine::Bool`: flag to initialize the ducted fan and fuel cell model
        - `true`  â†’ initialize variables for iteration
        - `false` â†’ use current variables as initial guesses
    - `iterw::Int64`: sizing loop iteration (optional, defaults to 0)

    **Output:**
    No direct outputs. The `ac` object is modified with:
    - Updated fuel cell power (`fcdata.FC_power`)
    - Updated ducted fan performance parameters (`pare`)
    - Updated engine size and power requirements during the design phase

    VerifyRadiatorHeat(engine, imission)

Verifies the heat balance between the fuel cell and the radiator for a given mission. This function 
compares the heat rejected by the fuel cell with the heat absorbed by the radiator at each mission 
point. If a significant imbalance is found, an error is raised.

    No direct outputs. If a heat imbalance is detected, the function throws an error with 
    information about the mission point where the imbalance occurred.

!!! note
    The comparison uses a relative tolerance (`rtol`) of `1e-6` to account for small numerical discrepancies.
