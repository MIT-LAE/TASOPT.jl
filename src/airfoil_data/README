Database files implementing cd(Mach,cl,t/c) functions for families of airfoils.

C.air
C-series modern transonic airfoils, 9.0% to 14.5% thick.

Cl.air
C-series with laminar flow on the bottom surface, up to about 60% chord.

E.air
E-series modern transonic airfoils, 9.0% to 14.5% thick.
Compared to the C-series, the E-series have a deeper aft undercamber.
This gives them a bit higher Mach capability, at the cost of slightly 
more drag, more negative cm, larger hinge moment, and a smaller trailing
edge wedge angle.
