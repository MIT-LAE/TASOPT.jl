# Design and evaluation

## [Sizing the aircraft] (@id sizing)

The aircraft is sized via a fixed point iteration for the design mission ([`size_aircraft!()`](@ref TASOPT.size_aircraft!)). The performance of the design can be evaluated for the design and off-design missions (`imission` > 1; [`fly_mission!()`](@ref TASOPT.fly_mission!)).

[`size_aircraft!()`](@ref TASOPT.size_aircraft!) is typically the driving function in an analysis, as is the case in the `size_aircraft!()` call as demonstrated in the [first example] (@ref firstexample). The sizing analysis calls the various performance subroutines (e.g., `fusebl!()`, `wing_weights!()`, `aircraft_drag!()`, `mission_iter!()`, etc.) as shown in the [TASOPT flowchart](@ref flowchart). These subroutines are called automatically within [`_size_aircraft!()`](@ref TASOPT._size_aircraft!), which is wrapped by the user-facing [`size_aircraft!()`](@ref TASOPT.size_aircraft!).

!!! details "üñ•Ô∏è Code structure - Aircraft sizing" 
    The aircraft-sizing function requires an `aircraft` object as input. See [`read_aircraft_model()`](@ref TASOPT.read_aircraft_model) to get an idea of the fields that are required in this object. This object is unpacked into storage arrays and other component objects, such as `wing`, `fuselage` or `engine`. The eventual aim is to eliminate all data storage array and replace them by component objects but this is still work in progress.  

    The first major function called within [`size_aircraft!()`](@ref TASOPT.size_aircraft!) is [`fusebl!()`](@ref TASOPT.fusebl!), which calculates the fuselage boundary layer properties and drag coefficients for start-of-cruise; these are then used in other mission points. [`size_aircraft!()`](@ref TASOPT.size_aircraft!) then uses simplified methods to initialize the relevant aircraft weights and parameters, unless the user specifies otherwise with an optional input (`init_weight=true`). The bulk of the computational cost and time is spent in the weight sizing loop. After the weight sizing loop is completed, the aircraft takeoff performance and field lengths are calculated using [`takeoff!()`](@ref TASOPT.takeoff!).

    ### Weight sizing loop

    [`size_aircraft!()`](@ref TASOPT.size_aircraft!) performs a fixed point iteration by sequentially running weight and performance models for the different aircraft components. This is done via a `for` loop that gets terminated once the maximum aircraft weight has converged within a desired tolerance. The solver will fail to converge for infeasible combinations of aircraft and missions. The solver may fail to converge due to poor initial guesses (or conditioning); this can be addressed by adjusting the initial guess or raising the maximum number of iterations.

    The fuselage weight is calculated first in the sizing loop through [`fusew!()`](@ref TASOPT.fusew!). Then, the total maximum takeoff weight gets recomputed and there is a check for whether the sizing loop is terminated. If weight has not converged, the loop continues.

    The wing geometry is set by running [`set_wing_geometry!()`](@ref TASOPT.set_wing_geometry!) and the wing pitching moments are computed through [`wing_CM()`](@ref TASOPT.wing_CM). The horizontal and vertical tail geometry is computed through [`tailpo!()`](@ref TASOPT.tailpo!). Finally, the weights of the three aerodynamic surfaces are calculated by running [`wing_weights!()`](@ref TASOPT.wing_weights!).

    If the aircraft requires an insulated fuel tank in the fuselage, for example, if the fuel is cryogenic, the tank is sized using [`tanksize!()`](@ref TASOPT.tanksize!); this function calculates the structural weight and sizes the thermal insulation. For details on how the fuel tank is sized, see [Fuel tanks](@ref fueltanks). The sized tank dimensions are then use to recalculate the fuselage geometry to accommodate the tank in [`update_fuse!()`](@ref TASOPT.update_fuse!).

    The weight and balance of the aircraft at start-of-cruise is adjusted using [`balance_aircraft!()`](@ref TASOPT.balance_aircraft!). This can move the wing, resize the horizontal tail, or change the tail trim to achieve a desired metric for longitudinal stability (e.g., a set static margin).

    The total drag at start-of-cruise, which is the engine design point, is calculated using [`aircraft_drag!()`](@ref aerodynamics.aircraft_drag!). This function calls a combination of models for the drag of aerodynamic surfaces, engine nacelle, and induced drag at the Trefftz plane.

    The engines are sized at the start-of-cruise to produce a total thrust force equal to the aircraft drag, as computed by `aircraft.engine.enginecalc!()`, a *specifiable* function in the `engine` object. This field stores a user defined function for the engine performance. Although the user is free to use alternative models by modifying the `engine` object, TASOPT currently includes a two-spool turbofan engine model. The turbofan engine functions are called via a wrapper, [`tfwrap!()`](@ref TASOPT.tfwrap!), which in turns calls the engine calculation function [`tfcalc!()`](@ref engine.tfcalc!).

    Once the engines are sized, the fuel demand at every point in the mission is calculated using [`mission_iter!()`](@ref TASOPT.mission_iter!). This function in turn recalculates the balance, drag, and engine performance at every point. Further details on mission are provided below. [`mission_iter!()`](@ref TASOPT.mission_iter!) is usually the greatest time sink in an aircraft sizing. The weight gets updated after running [`mission_iter!()`](@ref TASOPT.mission_iter!) and the loop restarts.

## [Mission evaluation] (@id mission)

The function [`mission_iter!()`](@ref TASOPT.mission_iter!) contains the fuel burn calculation for the entire mission. It can be used both in sizing, as part of the iteration to obtain a converged aircraft, or in off-design, to calculate the performance of an already-designed airplane. Rather than calling [`mission_iter!()`](@ref TASOPT.mission_iter!) directly, users should call its user-facing wrapper, [`fly_mission!()`](@ref TASOPT.fly_mission!).

!!! details "üñ•Ô∏è Code structure - Mission"
    The [`mission_iter!()`](@ref TASOPT.mission_iter!) function simulates the entire mission of an aircraft, calculating fuel burn and other mission variables.

    From the altitude, the function sets the initial conditions including temperature, pressure, and density [`atmos()`](@ref TASOPT.atmos). Then, the lift coefficient is interpolated over the climb and descent points to ensure smooth transitions between different phases of the mission.

    Next, the function estimates the takeoff speed and sets the velocity and Reynolds number over the climb and descent points. This involves calculating the takeoff lift coefficient and using it to estimate the takeoff speed. The Reynolds number is then calculated based on the takeoff speed and other atmospheric conditions.

    The function proceeds to calculate the climb and descent parameters using aerodynamic and engine performance models. It integrates the climb and descent trajectories using a predictor-corrector scheme to update the range, time, and weight fractions.

    Once the climb and descent parameters are set, the function sets the conditions for the cruise phase, including altitude, speed, and fuel consumption. It calculates the fuel burn and weight fractions for the entire mission via calls to `engine.enginecalc!()`, and adds any vented fuel. This involves adjusting the aircraft's balance and trim settings via calls to [`balance_aircraft!()`](@ref TASOPT.balance_aircraft!) to ensure stability throughout the mission, and recalculating the drag via [`aircraft_drag!()`](@ref aerodynamics.aircraft_drag!).

    The function also sets up the climb points at equal altitude intervals and calculates the available thrust assuming maximum-throttle climb. It initializes the climb integrands and integrates the trajectory over the climb phase. The function calculates the cruise-climb angle based on available thrust and atmospheric conditions.

    The descent phase is then set up, with the function interpolating the descent points and integrating the time and weight over the descent. It calculates the velocity, Mach number, and Reynolds number for each descent point and adjusts the pitch trim by adjusting the horizontal tail lift coefficient.

    Finally, the function calculates the mission fuel fractions and weights, including the weight of any vented fuel; it updates the mission parameters, such as the takeoff and fuel weights, and computes the mission's payload-fuel energy intensity (PFEI; a productivity-specific energy metric in kJ/kg-km),

    ```math
    \mathrm{PFEI} = \frac{W_{f,b}\mathrm{LHV}}{g W_{pay} R},
    ```

    where ``W_{f,b}`` is the mission fuel burn weight, ``\mathrm{LHV}`` is the fuel's lower heating value, ``g`` is the acceleration of gravity, ``W_{pay}`` is the payload weight, and ``R`` is the mission range.

## [On- and off-design performance] (@id missionexec)

The function [`fly_mission!()`](@ref TASOPT.fly_mission!) can calculate the off-design performance of a *sized* aircraft: it runs the aircraft through a mission with different range, payload, and conditions to the design mission. For this purpose, it calls [`mission_iter!()`](@ref TASOPT.mission_iter!) and iterates the fuel burn until a converged takeoff mass is reached. If called on the design mission, the on-design performance is recovered. See [`PayloadRange()`](@ref TASOPT.PayloadRange) for an example of how [`fly_mission!()`](@ref TASOPT.fly_mission!) can be used.
