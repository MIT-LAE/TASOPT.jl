# Drag

The key drag contributions are assumed to come from the fuselage, wing and tail surfaces, and the lift-induced drag calculated at the Trefftz plane. Wave drag is not explicitly modelled.


## [Axisymmetric fuselage drag](@id axi)
The fuselage profile drag is determined by a quasi-axisymmetric coupled viscous-inviscid calculation. See [Simplified Viscous/Inviscid Analysis for Nearly-Axisymmetric Bodies](../assets/drela_TASOPT_2p16/axibl.pdf) by M. Drela.

This method does not require any wetted area approximations or fineness-ratio correlations, but does require the geometry to be specified in the form of a
cross-sectional area distribution $A{\scriptstyle (x)}$ and a
perimeter distribution $b_0{\scriptstyle (x)}$, shown in the
Figure below. For a round cross-section these are, of course, related. To allow treating
more general fuselage cross-sections, they are assumed to be specified
separately. The cross section sizes and shapes can vary along the body,
provided the variation is reasonably smooth.

## [Trefftz plane drag calculation](@id trefftz)

Trefftz plane analysis computes the induced drag from lifting surfaces. The lift distributions are propagated downstream, accounting for streamline contraction from fuselage thickness variation as shown in the Figure below. 

![](../assets/trefftz.png)
Two shaded streamtubes are shown. Wake center radius $y'_o$ is nonzero due to the fuselage viscous wake displacement area.

The vorticity in the wake is numerially integrated at collocation points to determine the overall induced drag.

Trefftz Plane vortices $i,i\!+\!1 \ldots$ and collocation points
$i\!+\!1/2$ used for velocity, impulse, and kinetic energy calculations.
Left/right symmetry is exploited.

## Wing and tail surfaces

Lifting surface drag is determined via `surfcd` (when constant airfoil section `cdf` and `cdp` are already determined), and `surfcd2` (when an explicit modelling and integration is desired). Airfoil performance is accessed via a lookup of precomputed airfoil data, `airfun`.

```@setup cfturb
include("../../../src/aero/cdsum.jl")

```
For example, the turbulent flat plate ``C_f`` for a ``Re`` of ``10e6`` can be calculated as follows:

```@example cfturb
Re = 10e6
cfturb(Re)
```
