# Lift

Surface lift distributions $\tilde{p}$ are defined in terms of a
baseline piecewise-linear distribution $p{\scriptstyle (\eta)}$ defined
like the chord planform, but with its own taper ratios $\gamma_s$ and
$\gamma_t$.

Piecewise-linear aerodynamic load ``\tilde{p} {\scriptstyle (\eta)}``,
with modifications at center and tip.

The segments are integrated to compute the lift contribution to the wing root load, ``p_o``, as required by structural computations. The sectional lift distribution is treated as an input to induced drag and surface drag computations.
