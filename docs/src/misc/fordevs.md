# [Notes for devs](@id fordevs)

!!! info
    `TASOPT.jl` is very much a WIP. Get at us on github, but search the issues first.  
    Thanks! ðŸ™‚

!!! tip "Tips"
    - Refer to the [data structures](@ref datastructs) to see where input file parameters end up.
    - Look out for `!!! compat` admonishments marking where things will likely change in the future.
    - References to NPSS are currently non-functional. We're working on replacing this functionality efficiently.
