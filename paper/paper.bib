  abstract = {The fundamental challenge facing today's aviation industry is to achieve net zero climate impacts while simultaneously sustaining growth and global connectivity. Aviation's impact on surface air quality, which is comparable to aviation's climate impact when monetized, further heightens this challenge. Prior studies have proposed solutions that aim to mitigate either aviation's climate or air quality impacts. No previous work has proposed an aircraft-energy system that simultaneously addresses both aviation's climate and air quality impacts. In this paper we (1) use a multi-disciplinary design approach to optimize aircraft and propulsion systems, (2) estimate lifecycle costs and emissions of producing sustainable fuels including the embodied emissions associated with electricity generation and fuel production, (3) use trajectory optimization to quantify the fuel penalty to avoid persistent contrail formation based on a full year of global flight operations (including, for the first time, contrail avoidance for a hydrogen burning aircraft), and (4) quantify climate and air quality benefits of the proposed solutions using a simplified climate model and sensitivities derived from a global chemistry transport model. We propagate uncertainties in environmental impacts using a Monte-Carlo approach. We use these models to propose and analyze near-zero environmental impact aircraft, which we define as having net zero climate warming and a greater than 95\% reduction in air quality impacts relative to present day. We contrast the environmental impacts of today's aircraft-energy system against one built around either ``drop-in'' fuels or hydrogen. We find that a ``zero-impact'' aircraft is possible using either hydrogen or power-to-liquid ``drop-in'' fuels. The proposed aircraft-energy systems reduce combined climate and air quality impacts by 99\%, with fuel costs increasing by 40\% for hydrogen and 70\% for power-to-liquid fueled aircraft relative to today's fleet (i.e., within the range of historical jet fuel price variation). Beyond the specific case presented here, this work presents a framework for holistic analysis of future aviation systems that considers both climate and air quality impacts.},

  abstract = {Aircraft environmental performance metrics including fuel burn, takeoff and landing noise, and gaseous emissions are increasingly driving the design and optimization of modern aircraft engines. Gradient-based methods can significantly reduce the computational resources required during their multidisciplinary optimizations. However, current state-of-the art noise modeling tools do not allow for effective computation of sensitivities of acoustic metrics with respect to engine design and control variables, and therefore cannot be easily integrated into multidisciplinary optimization tools. This paper presents the utility of the python Noise Assessment tool (known as pyNA): an aircraft noise estimation model providing sensitivities of acoustic metrics, enabling multidisciplinary optimization and optimal control of engines for low-noise aircraft. The model is used to assess the trades of environmental performance metrics in the clean-sheet engine design for the NASA supersonic technology concept airplane. For the engine examined, if the fan diameter is allowed to change while technology levels are held constant, the takeoff noise levels and emissions are found to be most sensitive to the design fan pressure ratio. For an engine with a fixed fan diameter, takeoff noise levels are found to be insensitive to design variables; whereas nitrogen oxide emissions and cruise thrust-specific fuel consumption are most sensitive to the engine fan and high-pressure compressor pressure ratios.},
